# DartLeagueRoleIdentify
DartLeagueRoleIdentify is a console application written in the Dart programming language. The purpose of the project is to identify the role of a League of Legends player based on their champion selection. The project uses an algorithm that was originally developed by meraki-analytics and has been rewritten in Dart for this implementation.
