# DartLeagueRoleIdentify
DartLeagueRoleIdentify is a console application written in the Dart programming language. The purpose of the project is to identify the role of a League of Legends player based on their champion selection.

The project uses an algorithm originally developed by meraki-analytics, a website that provides in-depth League of Legends statistics and analytics, and has been rewritten in Dart for this implementation. 
If you are interested in learning more about the original role identification algorithm or would like to contribute to its development, you can check out the original code repository on GitHub at https://github.com/meraki-analytics/role-identification.

We are grateful to meraki-analytics for developing this powerful algorithm and making it available to the public under the MIT License.
